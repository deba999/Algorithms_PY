Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
 
Example :  Input: n = 10, pick = 6  Output: 6  Accepted

BruteForce: O(n)
for i in range(1,n):
            if guess(i)==0:
                return i
        return n

            res=guess(m)
            
            if res==0:
                return m
            elif res<0:
                h=m-1
            else:
                l=m+1
        return -1
 
 
 #Ternary Search
 low=1
        high=n
        
        while low<=high:
            mid1 = low + (high - low) / 3;
            mid2 = high - (high - low) / 3;
            
            res1 = guess(mid1)
            res2 = guess(mid2)
            
            if (res1 == 0):
                return mid1
            if (res2 == 0):
                return mid2
            elif (res1 < 0) :
                high = mid1 - 1
            elif (res2 > 0) :
                low = mid2 + 1
            else :
                low = mid1 + 1
                high = mid2 - 1
        return -1
 
 #Ternary Search does more comparisons than Binary Search in the worst case.
 #Hence Binary search is preferred
